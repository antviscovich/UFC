# UFC Fight Predictor
For this project, I used the dataset of past UFC fights to create a machine learning model to correctly predict which fighter will win. 

My passion for mixed martial arts and data science makes this my favorite project to work on. I will use project as a stepping stone for other MMA/Data Science projects in the future. For now, I will keep modifying this project to better predict future outcomes for fights. The next step is to add the names in again and have the machine feed those back out.
